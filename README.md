## Getting Started with Game Servers in Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source project that bundles applications into lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers. For a crash course on running Dockerized game servers check out [Using Docker for Game
Servers](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/DockerAndGameServers.md). For tips, tricks,
and recommended tools for working with Laclede's LAN Dockerized game server repos see the guide for [Working with our
Game Server Repos](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/WorkingWithOurRepos.md). You can
also browse all of our other Dockerized game servers: [Laclede's LAN Game Servers
Directory](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/tree/master/GameServers).
